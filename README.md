# EMG Response Analysis – Neuroscience & Neural Engineering

This repository contains the lab report for the **"Introduction to Neuroscience and Neural Engineering"** course (NTUA, Academic Year 2024–2025), focusing on the analysis of EMG signals during an object lifting task.

## Overview
- EMG data: 9 muscle channels across multiple trials.
- Preprocessing and normalization.
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA, ICA.
- Feature extraction: temporal and spatial patterns.
- Classification: decoding task performance (correct vs. incorrect).

## Files
- `Neuroscience-EMG-Response.ipynb`: Full analysis notebook.

## Tools
Python, NumPy, pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
