# EMG Response Analysis ‚Äì Neuroscience & Neural Engineering

This repository contains the lab report for the **"Introduction to Neuroscience and Neural Engineering"** course (NTUA, Academic Year 2024‚Äì2025), focusing on the analysis of EMG signals during an object lifting task.

## üìò Project Overview

The objective of this assignment is to:
- Preprocess and analyze EMG data collected from 9 muscle channels.
- Characterize the neuromuscular response related to correct vs. incorrect task performance.
- Apply dimensionality reduction and decomposition techniques.
- Evaluate classification performance for decoding behavioral outcomes.

## üìÅ Dataset Description

### EMG Data
- Stored in the variable `processed_emg`.
- A cell array, where each **cell = one trial**.
- Each trial is a matrix of shape **N_timepoints √ó 9**, where 9 = muscle channels.

### Behavioral Data
Stored in `.csv` files with trial metadata:
- `response`: 1 = correct, 0 = incorrect.
- `reaction time`: in ms.
- `weight`: object weight.
- `direction`: movement direction.

**Target variable for classification**: `response`

## üß™ Methods

### ‚úÖ A. Dimensionality Reduction
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to normalized EMG data.
- Found that **107 principal components** explain 90% of the variance.

### ‚úÖ B. Visualization
- Plotted the first two **PCA coefficients** and their **trial-averaged scores**.
- Analysis revealed:
  - Clear activation patterns differentiating correct vs. incorrect responses.
  - Muscles 1 and 2 contributed most to class separability.

### ‚úÖ C. Source Separation
- Applied **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**.
- Explored differences between PCA and ICA for capturing task-relevant variance.

### ‚úÖ D. Feature Extraction & Classification
- Extracted temporal and spatial features.
- Trained classifiers to decode the `response` label.
- Evaluated classification performance using accuracy metrics.

## üìä Results

- PCA uncovered low-dimensional structure explaining most signal variance.
- Muscle-specific activation patterns were observed between correct/incorrect trials.
- Classification performance indicated discriminative patterns embedded in the EMG features.
